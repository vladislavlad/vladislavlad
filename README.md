### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vladislav Kartashov and I'm professional Software Engineer.

I have been studying Computer Science and Information Security at the BMSTU since 2013 for 6 years.
I started my career as Java Software Engineer more than 6 years ago.
I have also used Scala, Groovy and Python languages, but my Kotlin lang became my passion.

*Kotlin* is my main language since 2020. 

Now I'm also studying Go and Solidity.
